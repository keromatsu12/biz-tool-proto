  // Padding is often handled by l-main__inner, but if nested, it ensures content doesn't touch edges on small screens if l-main__inner padding is removed or different.
  // However, since l-main__inner has padding, l-container inside it might not need it, or might double it.
  // Standard bootstrap container has padding.
  // Let's rely on l-main__inner for outer padding, and l-container for max-width.
  // But if l-main__inner padding is small, we might want to ensure responsiveness.
  // For now, simple centering is the goal.
